# Session History {#sec-sessions}

This chapter maintains a running log of Claude Code analysis sessions.

**For reviewers**: This provides a transparent audit trail of how the analysis evolved over time.

## How Sessions Are Logged

Each session follows a standard format:

1. **Goal**: What we set out to do
2. **Completed**: What was actually accomplished
3. **Decisions**: Any analytical or methodological choices made (cross-referenced to @sec-decisions)
4. **Problems**: Issues encountered (cross-referenced to @sec-problems)
5. **Files Modified**: Which files were created or changed
6. **Next Steps**: What remains

Sessions are numbered and dated. Detailed hourly logs are stored in `quality_reports/session_logs/`.
