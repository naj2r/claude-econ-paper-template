# Literature Synthesizer: Rate, Organize, and Condense

**CORE PRINCIPLE: No pausing, no permission. Process all papers in one pass.**

## When This Skill Is Invoked

The user has a collection of paper summaries and wants them:
1. **Rated** by relevance to the study
2. **Organized** by subtopic category
3. **Condensed** into a synthesized literature review without bloat or redundancy

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS` — one of:
- Path to `paper_skims.md` or similar collection file
- Path to a directory containing `notes.md` files (from split-pdf reads)
- `all` — process everything in `docs/` and `articles/` directories

## Step 1: Collect All Paper Summaries

Read all available paper notes from:
1. `docs/paper_skims.md` — the master skim file
2. `articles/split_*/notes.md` — any deep-read notes from split-pdf
3. Any other `.md` files in `docs/` that contain paper summaries

Merge them. If a paper has both a skim AND split-pdf notes, **use the split-pdf notes** (more detailed).

## Step 2: Launch the Lit-Synthesizer Agent

Spawn a Task agent with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` and `model: "sonnet"` that:

1. Reads ALL paper summaries
2. Rates each paper 1-5 using the agent's scoring rubric
3. Assigns primary + optional secondary subtopic codes
4. Identifies redundancies and overlaps
5. Writes the synthesized output

**Agent prompt template:**
```
You are the lit-synthesizer agent. Read the agent specification at:
.claude/agents/lit-synthesizer.md

Then read all paper summaries provided below and produce the synthesized output.

Study context: [Load from study-parameters.md]

[PAPER SUMMARIES HERE]

Write the output to: docs/literature_synthesis.md
```

## Step 3: Write the Synthesized Output

The agent writes to `docs/literature_synthesis.md` containing:
1. **Relevance rankings table** — every paper scored and categorized
2. **Synthesized review by subtopic** — integrated narrative, NOT paper-by-paper summaries
3. **Gaps this study fills** — concise list
4. **Papers to cut** — low-relevance papers with justification

## Bloat Detection Rules

| Pattern | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Multiple papers making the same empirical point | Merge into one sentence citing all papers |
| Repeated "Connection to Our Study" for papers in same subtopic | State relevance ONCE per subtopic section |
| Multiple abstract-length summaries of similar papers | Condense to 1-2 sentences per paper within a narrative paragraph |
| Redundant institutional background | One paragraph max |
| Repeated theoretical explanations | One theoretical paragraph, cite all supporting papers |
| Papers with similar methods and similar findings | Lead with the highest-impact version, parenthetically cite the rest |

## Output Quality Check

Before finalizing, verify:
- [ ] Every top-tier paper is rated 4-5 and appears in the synthesis
- [ ] No subtopic section exceeds 1 page (~40 lines) of prose
- [ ] No two consecutive paragraphs make the same point
- [ ] All BibTeX keys use `authorYYYYdescriptor` format
- [ ] Effect sizes and p-values are preserved
